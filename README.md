# GameOfChoices

This is a small dialogue game. For every stage, you'll be presented a choice (for example "Coffee or Tea?") and asked to choose one of them. You can also choose "Other" and write anything you like there. Once the choice is made, a next question will pop up until there are no more questions in the bank.

You may play this game for yourself for fun or as a introspection practice but if you are developing characters, for example you are a writer, an actor, a game designer or a gamemaster in an RPG - you can enter the name of your character and then choose the choices that would suit him or her.

It's also possible to play with multiple characters at the same time to get a feeling of their differences and commonalities for every questions. 

At any point of the game, you can export the current log into a text file and get a neat character information sheet that can be shared, modified, or loaded back into the game to continue for that point.

Have fun!
